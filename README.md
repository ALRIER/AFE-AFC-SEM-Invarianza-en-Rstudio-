# AFE-AFC-SEM-Invarianza-en-Rstudio-

This code comprises three multivariate analyses. The first analysis is an EFA (exploratory factor analysis) with PCA (principal component analysis), based on a 'dark tourism perceived value scale' that was created. The objective of the EFA-PCA was to explore the underlying structure in a data sample obtained from an 821-participant Likert scale. To review this part of the study, please refer to the file named 'First_model_PCA_EFA.ipynb.'

The second part consists of CFA, SEM & Invariance, which can be found in the file named 'AFC-SEM.PDF.'

Having identified the underlying structure, we conducted a CFA (confirmatory factor analysis) to compare different theoretical models and identify the best fit for the data.

Two additional techniques were employed in this study. First, an SEM (structural equation model) was used to identify the possible relationship between a client's perceived value and other variables related to their intention to buy a product and share information about it on the internet.

Finally, an invariance analysis was conducted to determine if there were any differences in how age and sex groups perceived the value of the product and service previously mentioned.

This repository has resulted in two publications, one in Spanish and the other in English.
