# AFE-AFC-SEM-Invarianza-en-Rstudio-

This code contains 3 multivariate analyses. The first one is an exploratory Factor analysis and a principal components analysis, these statistical techniques based on a "dark tourism scale" created by myself. The objective of the EFA was to see if the scale had the number of dimensions we thought. 

Once we saw that, we proceed to make a Confirmatory factorial analysis in order to understand the best theoretical model that fitted the data.

Finally, we made an invariance analysis in order to understand if there were any differences between women and man groups in the perception of this kind of tourism and see the possibility to buy the services. 

I have two publications with this inormation, one in spanish and the second in english.
